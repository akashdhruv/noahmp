PROMPT END*/

  To create a FORTRAN-C interface for this module, you will need to create a new module file that defines the interface between the FORTRAN and C++ code. Here is an example of how you might do this:

module ConfigVarInitMod_C

  use ConfigVarInitMod
  use Machine
  use NoahmpVarType

  implicit none

  interface
    subroutine ConfigVarInitDefault(noahmp) bind(C, name="ConfigVarInitDefault")
      import :: noahmp_type
      type(noahmp_type), intent(inout) :: noahmp
    end subroutine ConfigVarInitDefault
  end interface

end module ConfigVarInitMod_C

This module defines an interface between the FORTRAN and C++ code, and includes the necessary type definitions and subroutines to call the FORTRAN code from C++. The interface is defined using the "bind(C, name)" attribute, which specifies that the subroutine should be called from C++ code using the specified name.

To use this interface in your C++ code, you will need to include the header file for the module, and then call the subroutine using the appropriate syntax. For example:

#include "ConfigVarInitMod_C.h"

void ConfigVarInitDefault(noahmp_type noahmp) {
  ConfigVarInitDefault(noahmp);
}

This code defines a C++ function called "ConfigVarInitDefault" that calls the FORTRAN subroutine "ConfigVarInitDefault" with the appropriate arguments. The "noahmp_type" argument is defined in the "NoahmpVarType" module, and is used to pass the necessary data structures between the FORTRAN and C++ code.

Note that this is just one possible way to create a FORTRAN-C interface for your code. There are many other ways to do this, and the specific approach you choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
